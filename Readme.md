# Recurrent of AC model Results
 
----

For Two nodes

![avatar](/figure_all/Two_node.png)

Tried two simple results for two nodes. The predict results are same to the exact results.

----

For Three nodes

![avatar](/figure_all/Three_node.png)

Tried one simple results for three nodes. The difference comes from ignore the power of the middle node.

----

For another three nodes

![avatar](/figure_all/Another_three_node.png)

Tried one results for three nodes. The difference comes from ignore the power of the middle node. Use the notion of equivalent resistence.

----

For one generator and lots load (Use equivalent resistence to eliminate other resistences except the target one.)

![avatar](/figure_all/One_gen.png)

Tried one results for several nodes. The accuracy is about 15%.
