----
This is the simulation part of formula that calculated \sum_i Y_i - Y_i'


```
runpf(case_GB)
```

The raw_code folder transfer the data in OATS style of GB network into MATPOWER style.

See more details in [A reduced representative GB network](https://oats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/networkdata.html#a-reduced-representative-gb-network).

It contains vivid picture with buses, branches and generators.
